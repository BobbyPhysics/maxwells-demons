We want to study how varying some of the\r\nsimulation parameters affects the accuracy of the simulations and extract thermodynamic\r\nproperties from the simulations. You will write a short “letter”-style paper to communicate,\r\ndiscuss and summarize your reasoning and your results.\r\n\r\nDue Tue, March 22, 2016, 1:30pm.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
