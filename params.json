We want to study how varying some of the\r\nsimulation parameters affects the accuracy of the simulations and extract thermodynamic\r\nproperties from the simulations. You will write a short “letter”-style paper to communicate,\r\ndiscuss and summarize your reasoning and your results.\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n###Sample Code:      \r\n```python\r\n        for i in range(N):    # nested loop that calculates the LJ force and the difference between atoms\r\n            for j in range(i+1, N):\r\n                if i == j:\r\n                    continue\r\n                dr = r[0, j]-r[0, i] # t = 0 and dr is the updated difference vector \r\n                mdr = minimage(dr,box)\r\n                Fij = F_LJ(mdr) # Lennard Jones force calculation \r\n                F[0, i, :] += Fij   # total force for all atom\r\n                F[0, j, :] += -Fij\r\n                Uij = U_LJ_fast(mdr) # Lennard Jones potential energy calculation \r\n                U[0, i] += Uij   # total potential energy for all atoms\r\n                U[0, j] += Uij\r\n                H[0] = .5*np.sum(U[0]) + np.sum(K[0]) #Hamiltion at t = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
